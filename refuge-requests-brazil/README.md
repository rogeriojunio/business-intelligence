# refuge-requests-brazil
### Using Python and Power BI to create a business intelligence dashboard showing the evolution of refuge requests evolution

In this project, my colleagues and I prepared a dashboard using public datasets that can help the government better manage refuge requests in Brazil. Here we are not trying to create a forecast model, we just analyze the data to visualize the solicitations raised and understand if Brazil is prepared to receive vulnerable people.

Access the notebook to understand a little about the refugee program and how the data was processed.
